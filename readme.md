# Spotlight

This program downloads wallpapers from Spotlight (Windows 10), Chromecast and
Bing according to the user's configuration. It will store the images in a
directory named "download".

You can select which orientation (landscape / portrait) the images should have
in order to be considered for download.

Additionally you can select whether to show titles (if available) or not.


## Technical information

This project was created with Qt-Creator (4.4.1) and Qt 5.9.2 on both Windows 10
and Linux (Devuan ascii/ceres). On Windows the Visual C++ compiler was used to
create a 64 bit based binary. However, it should work fine for 32 Bit systems too.
 
## Icons

Icons are from the tango icon set or derived from it.
